# claude

Claude Code launch task, initial-prompt submit/readiness composition, and
structured delivery via the channel-server daemon. Split out of the former
`session/runtime` plugin per `docs/design/plugin-boundary-contracts.md`;
`gh-guard` moved to the `github` plugin, and `tmux` is a separate,
independently selectable plugin this one composes through `{ terminal = "..." }` — never a direct dependency.

## Contents

- `config/tasks/runtime.toml` — the `runtime` effect. `setup` launches `claude`
  (fresh or `--resume`, with a same-session-id fallback if resume finds no
  persisted conversation) via `{ terminal = "send_text" }`/`{ terminal = "send_keys" }`, waits for it to come up by polling
  `~/.claude/sessions/*.json`, wires a channel-server MCP socket when
  `channel-server` is on `PATH`, and registers turn-boundary activity and
  turn-reporting hooks (`publish_events`, see Parameters below). Before
  typing the launch line it records the session's workspace directory as
  trusted in `~/.claude.json`, which is what keeps the CLI's first-run
  workspace-trust prompt — whose default choice is refusal — from consuming
  the launch's own keystrokes; see
  `docs/adr/2026-09-13-agent-workspace-trust-at-launch.md`.
  `[health].alive` self-heals a stale pid by re-deriving the live
  process from the pane's process tree, reached via
  `{ terminal = "pid" }` for the pane's own root process id, so a
  crash-and-relaunch or a manual `--resume` does not require a session
  down/up to keep event delivery working. `[health].activity` reads back the
  record those turn-boundary hooks write, so hook and probe are two halves of
  one fingerprint format.
- `config/tasks/claude_initial_prompt.toml` — sends a session's initial prompt via
  `{ terminal = "..." }` once the CLI's input box is visible, or on every
  `plect up` when `repeat = "true"`.
- `config/channels/delivery.toml` — the `delivery` channel: it delivers a session event to the running
  Claude Code process over its channel-server Unix socket.
- `scripts/claude-mcp-servers` — the author-fixed serialization step behind the
  `runtime` effect's `mcp_servers` parameter: it merges the declared registration
  records into the MCP config that task assembles, and fails the launch on a
  malformed record rather than dropping it.
- `scripts/claude-agent-activity` — the turn-boundary activity fingerprint
  (setting `silence_expected` once a turn ends, and withholding it inside a
  turn: the hook the `runtime` effect registers, and the `probe` verb that
  task declares as its `[health].activity`), and the turn-reporting hooks
  that publish the agent's own text as core events — see Turn Reporting
  below. One executable, one selftest
  (`scripts/claude-agent-activity_selftest.sh`).
- `src/channel-server/` — generic message delivery to Claude Code, with no
  knowledge of message sources (Slack or otherwise) and no reply tool of its
  own (see Turn Reporting below). See `src/channel-server/CLAUDE.md`.

## Turn Reporting

An agent's Slack thread (or any other consumer of its session events)
reports what the agent said without the agent having to call any tool: the
`runtime` effect's `publish_events` input (default `["message"]`) names
which core events (`plect.message`, `plect.message_delta` — the type names
without their `plect.` prefix) to publish; the same input name and
semantics as every other runtime plugin in this catalog, so a workflow
reads identically across Claude, Codex, and future harnesses. Which Claude
Code hooks that installs is this plugin's own concern:

- `"message"` installs the `Stop` hook. `"message_delta"` installs
  `MessageDisplay`. Both may be requested together.
- `plect.message` is canonical: it is always emitted, exactly once per
  `message_id`. With `"message"` alone, it comes from that turn's
  `last_assistant_message`, with a deterministic `message_id`
  (`message_id_origin = synthetic` — Stop's `prompt_id` when present,
  since that already identifies the turn uniquely within the session; a
  per-session counter on the one boundary Stop exposes no `prompt_id` for
  at all) and `turn_id` from that same `prompt_id`. With `"message_delta"`
  also requested, it is published once a message's final delta arrives
  (full text now known), carrying that delta's own `message_id`
  (`message_id_origin = native`) and `turn_id`; `claude-agent-activity`
  itself then skips the Stop-hook copy for that same message (a marker
  file records which message_id was just covered), so a live consumer and
  a finished-messages consumer never both see the text and never see it
  twice. Metadata otherwise: `role = assistant`, `source = claude`.
- `"message_delta"` also publishes `plect.message_delta` once per streamed
  delta, as a preview: body is that delta alone, metadata carries
  `message_id`, `message_id_origin = native`, `kind = text`, `turn_id`,
  `index`, `final`, `source = claude`. `index` is this hook's own counter
  per `message_id` (0-based, one per delta actually published), not
  Claude's own `index` field from the hook payload, which a future harness
  could give a different meaning to (e.g. a block index).
- An empty message publishes nothing, and neither does an empty *non-final*
  delta. An empty *final* delta is the one exception: it still publishes
  (empty body, `final = true`), because Claude Code's own newline-driven
  delta split routinely lands a message's last hook invocation on empty
  text, and a delta-driven consumer needs an actual `final = true` delta to
  close its stream — it does not necessarily watch `plect.message`, a
  different event type, to know the stream ended. A publish failure
  (`plect` unreachable) never blocks or delays the agent's turn — every
  hook exit path is 0.
- A consumer that wants only finished messages includes `plect.message`;
  one that wants a live view includes `plect.message_delta` too and
  replaces its running preview with the `plect.message` for the same
  `message_id` once it arrives.

## Parameters

Author-declared values a workflow sets to steer these configs without
replacing them (the parameterization rung of
`docs/design/task-nesting.md`'s customization ladder):

| Config | Parameter | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `tasks/runtime.toml` | `launch_env` | JSON object of environment variables exported on the launch line. Keys must be valid environment variable names; values are shell-quoted. |
| `tasks/runtime.toml` | `mcp_servers` | JSON array of MCP server registration records — `{name, command, args?, env?}` — merged into the `--mcp-config` JSON alongside this task's own registrations. A record only ever reaches the agent's config file, never a command line; a name that collides with a registration the task already made, or a record missing `name`/`command`, fails the launch. |
| `tasks/runtime.toml` | `launch_timeout` | How long the launch poll waits for `claude`'s session file to register, as a `"<seconds>s"` token. Default `120s`. On timeout, or any other non-zero setup exit after the process was started, the pane's `claude` child is terminated before the node fails, so a retry never types into a still-live process. |
| `tasks/runtime.toml` | `permission_mode` | `--permission-mode <value>` on the launch line, one of `claude`'s own mode names or `""` to omit the flag. Default `bypassPermissions`, so a dispatched session never blocks on the CLI's first-run "Set up auto mode?" wizard. The default also seeds `skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt` into the hooks settings file, since `bypassPermissions` itself carries a one-time interactive disclaimer on an account/host that has never accepted it. |
| `tasks/runtime.toml` | `publish_events` | Array of core event names to publish (`"message"`, `"message_delta"`), without their `plect.` prefix. Default `["message"]`. See Turn Reporting above. |

These are set on the node or channel binding that selects the declaration, as
values over the workflow surface's own roots. A user-owned workflow names a
plugin's declaration by its catalog address — the alias you enabled this plugin
under, then its plugin path, then the declaration's id:

```toml
[[my_workflow.nodes]]
id   = "agent"
uses = "official.claude.runtime"

[my_workflow.nodes.inputs]
launch_env   = '{"PLECT_TEAM_CONTEXT":"acme"}'
mcp_servers  = '[{"name":"kbn","command":"kbn-mcp","args":["--scoped"]}]'

[[my_workflow.event.channel]]
name    = "runtime"
uses    = "official.claude.delivery"
include = ["plect.instruction", "user.emit"]

[my_workflow.event.channel.inputs]
path = { from = "nodes.agent.outputs.socket_path" }
```

`docs/language/workflows.md` specifies that surface and
`docs/language/declarations.md` the reference grammar; substitute your own alias
for `official`.

## Install

```bash
plect catalog add official git+https://github.com/kecbigmt/plecture --subdir plugins --revision <tag-or-commit>
plect plugin add official/claude
```

Building `channel-server` requires a Go toolchain (see the Package format
section of `docs/design/plugin-packaging.md`); `plect plugin add`/`update`
builds it automatically.

A session using this plugin also needs a `[terminal]`-declaring task in the
workflow (e.g. `official/tmux`'s `tmux` task) — this plugin's own tasks
never declare `[terminal]` themselves.

## Resident-supervised Services

`channel-server` is declared as a `[[services]]` in `plugin.toml`,
supervised by `plect serve` (start, crash-restart with backoff, stop with
the resident process). Its declaration stays inert today by design: real
instances are per-session, launched by Claude Code itself via MCP
configuration with a session-specific `CHANNEL_SOCKET_PATH` the resident
process never has — see `plugin.toml`'s comment and
`docs/adr/2026-08-16-plugin-service-lifecycle.md`'s Consequences section.

## Not included

- Which agent CLI a session launches beyond Claude Code, and any model/
  effort defaults for other CLIs — a workflow's concern.
- The write guard for `gh` — see the `github` plugin's `gh_guard` task; this
  plugin's `runtime` effect accepts only a generic `path_prepend` input, never
  a GitHub-specific switch.
- A no-channel-server interactive Claude configuration is outside the
  supported surface — see `docs/migrations/` for the migration procedure.
