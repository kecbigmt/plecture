# slack-adapter -- Slack adapter for channel-server

Creates and posts to Slack threads over HTTP. When an app token is configured
it also keeps a Socket Mode connection to Slack and routes messages to/from
Claude Code sessions (channel-server) over a Unix socket.

## Architecture

```
plect up
  ├─ POST slack-adapter:7890/threads         → create a Slack thread
  ├─ tmux + claude (run-scoped tasks)      → start claude, resolve socket_path
  └─ POST slack-adapter:7890/subscribe       → register thread_ts → socket_path with the broker

       channel-server (MCP, one per session)
            │ Unix socket (CHANNEL_SOCKET_PATH)
            ▼
       slack-adapter (long-running broker)
            │ in-memory map: thread_ts → {channel_id, socket_path, session_name, since, delivered_through}
            │ Slack Socket Mode (1 connection)
            ▼
          Slack
```

slack-adapter never reads plect's state.json. Every subscription is registered
and torn down explicitly through the HTTP API.

## Configuration

### config file (`~/.config/slack-adapter/config.toml`)

```toml
slack_bot_token = "xoxb-..."
slack_app_token = "xapp-..." # optional; enables Socket Mode inbound relay
channel_id = "C..."          # optional default for requests without channel_id
listen_addr = "127.0.0.1:7890"
allowed_user_ids = ["U..."]
deliver_full_thread = false # optional; default is root + delta on @-mention
status_ttl = "15m"          # optional; clears a stale status if nothing posts by then
on_unbound_mention = "/path/to/dispatch-command" # optional; see below
```

`on_unbound_mention` can also be set via `SLACK_ADAPTER_ON_UNBOUND_MENTION`,
subject to the same config-file-wins-over-env-var rule as the credential
fields above.

Outbound-only operation requires only `slack_bot_token`. Requests that omit
`channel_id` require the optional configured default.

### Thread status (shimmer)

slack-adapter never sets a bound thread's assistant status line
(`assistant.threads.setStatus`) on inbound receipt (a message or an
app-mention): the adapter cannot confirm delivery reached a live runtime,
so a shimmer set at receipt time would assert progress the system has not
observed. The shimmer is instead driven entirely by
`POST /status` — the `status` channel a workflow wires to the runtime's own
`plect.status_message` reports (see the top-level `plugins/slack` README) —
so it only ever shows what a live runtime has actually said about itself.
Once shown, the status is cleared once the session posts a reply or a
permission prompt through this adapter, or after `status_ttl` elapses with
nothing posted (covers a session that ends its turn without ever calling
reply).

`status_loading_messages` (the old receipt-time shimmer's text) is a
retired config key: `ValidateStartup` fails startup with an error naming it
if a `config.toml` still sets it, rather than silently ignoring a setting
that no longer does anything. See
`docs/migrations/slack-status-loading-messages-migration.md` to remove it.

There is no `status_text` config: confirmed empirically against real Slack
workspaces, a channel thread never renders `assistant.threads.setStatus`'s
`status` string, only `loading_messages`. `SetThreadStatus`'s `status`
parameter (and `POST /status`'s `status` field) stay purely an on/off flag
because of this — the API still requires a non-empty value to mean "show" —
and a caller who wants text supplies it via `loading_messages`.
`StatusManager.Set` always clears before it sets, because a
`loading_messages` entry sent right after a prior status-only call on the
same thread was observed to flash once and revert to Slack's default text,
while the same entry sent right after an explicit clear renders
persistently.

When Socket Mode is enabled, an `app_mention` in a subscribed thread publishes
one inbound `user.emit` to the bound `session_name`. The event body is an
ordered Slack transcript with display names, message times, and text. By
default each delivery includes the root message plus only replies after the
thread's last successful delivery watermark, followed by the mentioning
message. Set `deliver_full_thread = true` to send the full thread on every
mention. Empty `allowed_user_ids` allows any channel member to drive this
mention path; setting it restricts app mentions to the listed Slack users.

### `on_unbound_mention` hook

An `app_mention` that resolves to no subscription is normally logged and
dropped (`app mention skipped: unbound thread`). When `on_unbound_mention` is
set, slack-adapter instead runs that command once, with a JSON document on
stdin describing the mention, and logs its exit status. `allowed_user_ids`
is applied first, so a mention from a disallowed user never reaches the
hook. A top-level mention (no `thread_ts`) is treated as the root of a new
thread: `thread_ts` in the payload equals the mention's own `ts`. A mention
in a *bound* thread is unaffected — the hook only fires where today's code
drops the event.

```json
{"channel_id": "C...", "thread_ts": "1788222413.916339", "ts": "1788224629.760139", "user": "U...", "text": "<@U...> ...", "permalink": "https://<ws>.slack.com/archives/C.../p..."}
```

slack-adapter does not wait for anything beyond the command's exit status
(logged) and never retries. Everything else — which channels to honour,
which workflow to start, rate limits — is the command's job, not this
plugin's: it is deployment policy, and the adapter stays a source-agnostic
relay. A typical command runs
`plect up <permalink> --workflow <wf> --inputs '{"mention_ts": "<ts>"}'`,
and the workflow's `slack_subscribe` node (with `catch_up_through =
mention_ts`) brings the thread's history, including the triggering mention,
to the runtime.

## HTTP API

### GET /info

Returns the workspace name and default channel ID. The workspace name is
fetched from Slack's `auth.test` API at startup and cached.

```json
// Response
{"workspace": "my-team", "channel_id": "C..."}
```

### POST /threads

Posts a message to a Slack channel, creating a thread. Returns `thread_ts`,
`channel_id`, and Slack's `chat.getPermalink` URL.

```json
// Request
{"channel_id": "C...", "text": "session start message"}

// Response
{"thread_ts": "1234567890.123456", "channel_id": "C...", "permalink": "https://example.slack.com/archives/C.../p1234567890123456"}
```

### POST /messages

Posts a message to an existing thread. The shipped `slack` channel uses this
endpoint for `plect.judge.recorded` delivery, posting the recorded judge
reason as the reply text.

```json
// Request
{"thread_ts": "1234567890.123456", "channel_id": "C...", "text": "message body"}
```

### POST /subscribe

Registers a `thread_ts` → `socket_path` subscription. slack-adapter keeps
`{thread_ts, channel_id, socket_path, session_name, since, delivered_through}`
in an internal map and routes incoming Slack messages to the right socket in
O(1). Registration also pre-connects to channel-server, so claude's replies
flow to Slack right away. `session_name` is required for app-mention
deliberation delivery because it is the target for `plect event publish`.

An optional `catch_up_through` (a Slack message ts) delivers the thread's
existing history once, on first binding: covers the escalation shape where
people discuss something in a thread and then mention the bot, which
otherwise drops both the triggering mention (no session exists yet to
receive it) and everything said before it. When set, and the subscription's
`delivered_through` is empty or older than it, slack-adapter fetches the
thread, publishes root + every reply through `catch_up_through` as one
inbound `user.emit`, and advances `delivered_through` to it — the same
transcript format app-mention deliberation uses. Re-posting the same
`catch_up_through` (e.g. a runtime restart re-running the run-scoped
`slack_subscribe` task) is a no-op once the watermark already covers it.
Omitting the field leaves behaviour unchanged.

`delivered_through` also survives a clean unsubscribe: `DELETE /subscribe`
tombstones it instead of dropping it, and a subsequent `/subscribe` for the
same `thread_ts` **and** `session_name` restores it before evaluating
`catch_up_through`. This is what keeps a `plect down` / `plect up` cycle (or
an ECS task replacement doing the same) from redelivering the thread
transcript on every deployment — see Persistence below. A different
`session_name` binding the same thread later is a new subscription, not a
resumed one, and gets no watermark.

```json
// Request
{"thread_ts": "1234567890.123456", "channel_id": "C...", "socket_path": "/run/user/1000/claude-channel/<uuid>.sock", "session_name": "owner/repo-1", "catch_up_through": "1234567890.654321"}

// Response
{"thread_ts": "1234567890.123456", "channel_id": "C...", "socket_path": "...", "session_name": "owner/repo-1", "since": "2026-05-17T00:00:00Z", "delivered_through": "1234567890.654321"}
```

### POST /status

Sets or clears a thread's assistant shimmer status line directly, without
posting a message. `status` is only an on/off flag (empty clears; any
non-empty value shows); the visible text belongs in `loading_messages` (max
10) — `status`'s own content never renders in a channel thread. Wiring this
to agent hooks (e.g. reporting the current tool name as status) is left to a
caller of this endpoint, not built into the plugin.

```json
// Request
{"thread_ts": "1234567890.123456", "channel_id": "C...", "status": "1", "loading_messages": ["Checking CI…"]}

// Request (clear)
{"thread_ts": "1234567890.123456", "channel_id": "C...", "status": ""}
```

### DELETE /subscribe?thread_ts=...

Unsubscribes. A missing `thread_ts` is a no-op (`204`). Called from `plect
down` / `destroy` cleanup. If the subscription had a non-empty
`delivered_through`, it is preserved as a tombstone (see `POST /subscribe`
above and Persistence below), not discarded.

### GET /subscribers

Returns the current subscription list. Used by the task's `[health].alive`
probe to determine whether its own `thread_ts` is still registered with the
broker. If a broker restart dropped it, the probe goes non-zero and the next
`plect up` re-runs setup.

```json
{"subscribers": [{"thread_ts": "...", "channel_id": "...", "socket_path": "...", "since": "..."}]}
```

## Routing

`thread_ts` → `socket_path` resolves through an in-memory map. Subscriptions
are registered explicitly via `/subscribe`.

On an incoming message, if the subscriber's `socket_path` no longer exists, it
is lazily removed from the map and a failure notice is posted to the Slack
thread.

## Persistence

Subscriptions and unsubscribed threads' delivery tombstones are persisted to
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/slack-adapter/subscribers.json` (default
`~/.local/state/slack-adapter/subscribers.json`) as
`{"subscribers": [...], "tombstones": [...]}`, with an atomic write (tmp →
rename) on every subscribe/unsubscribe. Restarting slack-adapter reads it
back at startup, so subscriptions survive a restart and routing continues
without any action on the plect side. A failed read-back (missing or corrupt
file, including the bare-array shape this file held before tombstones
existed — see `docs/migrations/slack-adapter-subscribers-envelope-migration.md`)
logs a warning and starts with an empty state, which the next `/subscribe`
repopulates.

**Operational requirement:** this state directory must live on the same
persistent storage as plect's own state. `official.slack.slack_subscribe` is
run-scoped — its cleanup runs `DELETE /subscribe` on every `plect down`, and
the following `plect up` re-subscribes — so the tombstoned `delivered_through`
watermark is the only thing standing between a routine restart and
redelivering the whole thread transcript to the resumed session. In a
container, put `HOME` (or `XDG_STATE_HOME` directly) on the volume that
survives a redeploy. A tombstone older than 30 days is dropped on load and on
every persist, regardless of storage — it is assumed no session will resume
against it by then.

## Setting up the Slack App

For outbound threads only:

1. Create an app at [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Add Bot Token Scopes under **OAuth & Permissions**:
   - `chat:write` -- post messages
3. Install to the workspace and get the Bot Token (`xoxb-`)
4. Invite the bot to the target channel (`/invite @botname`)

See `slack-app-manifest.yml` for the app manifest.

For inbound thread deliberation, enable Socket Mode, create an app-level token
with `connections:write`, configure it as `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`, subscribe the app
to `app_mention`, and add Bot Token Scopes:

- `app_mentions:read` -- receive bot mentions
- `channels:history` -- fetch public-channel thread replies
- `groups:history` -- fetch private-channel thread replies, only when private
  channels are used
- `users:read` -- resolve display names

## Claude Code hooks (`~/.claude/settings.json`)

The SessionStart / Stop / TaskCreated / SubagentStart / SubagentStop hooks
post status updates to the Slack thread. Add the following to `settings.json`
(replace the command path with wherever you install the notify script, e.g.
`/path/to/your/scripts/claude-slack-notify.sh`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/path/to/your/scripts/claude-slack-notify.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/path/to/your/scripts/claude-slack-notify.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "TaskCreated": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/path/to/your/scripts/claude-slack-notify.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "SubagentStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/path/to/your/scripts/claude-slack-notify.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "SubagentStop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/path/to/your/scripts/claude-slack-notify.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The hook script no-ops for sessions without `SLACK_THREAD_TS` set (i.e.
non-plect sessions).

## Running as a service

slack-adapter is a long-running broker process; run it under whatever process
supervisor your environment uses (systemd user service, launchd, a process
manager, etc.), started as `slack-adapter` and left resident. channel-server
is spawned per-session by Claude Code itself and doesn't need its own service
entry.
