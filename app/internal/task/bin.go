// resolveBin resolves a `{{bin ref}}` reference against mounted (the
// catalog-qualified plugins folded into the current config, in declaration
// order) to an absolute executable path. sourcePath is the file the
// referencing template came from — the catalog-load worktree's absolute
// path — used only to find ref's containing plugin for the bare-name
// reading below; pass "" when the template has no file origin (e.g. it was
// built in-process by a test).
//
// ref has two readings:
//
//   - A bare executable name (no "/"): resolves against the *containing*
//     plugin only — the plugin sourcePath was mounted from — matched
//     against that plugin's own `[[executables]]`. Shipped config never
//     knows the alias its catalog was registered under, so this is the
//     only form plugin-mounted content may use. It is unavailable when
//     sourcePath resolves to no mounted plugin (hand-authored config
//     outside any plugin has no "containing plugin" to resolve against).
//   - "<catalog-alias>/<plugin-path>[/<executable-name>]": the
//     fully-qualified form, for user-authored config referencing any
//     mounted plugin (its own or another's) by the alias the user chose at
//     registration. Two sub-readings are tried against every mounted
//     plugin:
//   - ref exactly equals the plugin's id: valid only when that plugin
//     declares exactly one executable (the terse common case).
//   - ref is "<plugin-id>/<executable-name>" for some mounted plugin id
//     and one of its declared executable names.
//     Both sub-readings can match for every mounted plugin whose id is a
//     prefix of ref, so nested plugin paths can collide: a reference is a
//     load error when more than one candidate resolution exists, because no
//     slash-based syntax can disambiguate that collision under
//     arbitrary-depth plugin paths — the design deliberately refuses to
//     guess.
