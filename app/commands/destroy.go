var destroyCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "destroy <resource-id|session>",
	Short: "Tear down a session via task cleanup",
	Long: `Tear down a session in four ordered steps:

  1. run-scoped cleanup (auto-down) — skipped if no run-scoped task is
     currently in "produced" status
  2. session-scoped cleanup
  3. provider cleanup
  4. state entry deletion

Default policy is fail-fast: the first cleanup error aborts the remaining
steps and the state entry is kept so you can inspect and retry. Use
--force to switch to best-effort teardown (see flag description).

--force means you accept losing unsaved local changes: it is forwarded to
provider cleanup, and a provider whose release step refuses on unsaved local
changes may discard them to complete the release instead of leaving them on
disk.

--input passes an opaque key=value cleanup intent through to provider
cleanup (repeatable); core does not interpret it. Consult the provider's own
docs for which keys it reads.

If the session has child sessions, destroy fails before any teardown step
runs: deleting it would orphan them (plect up never re-adopts an orphan). Use
--force to destroy anyway and orphan the children, or reset with
` + "`plect down`" + ` + ` + "`plect up`" + ` instead, which keeps the state entry and its
children intact.`,
