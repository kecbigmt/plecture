# Health declaration

This design is governed by
[`../adr/2026-08-18-health-declaration.md`](../adr/2026-08-18-health-declaration.md)
and, for the activity envelope's shape,
[`../adr/2026-08-18-activity-envelope-fingerprint-centric.md`](../adr/2026-08-18-activity-envelope-fingerprint-centric.md).

## Design Core

A task declares how its health is determined in one `[health]` table holding
two probes:

- **`alive`** — the liveness probe. Exit-code semantics: zero means the
  execution surface this task owns is present.
- **`activity`** — the activity probe. Fingerprint semantics: it writes a JSON
  activity envelope whose opaque fingerprint core compares across evaluations,
  and its exit code reports whether the probe itself is well.

`setup`, `cleanup`, and `[health]` are the universal task lifecycle trio: what
brings the surface up, what takes it down, and what says whether it is still
there and moving.

Probes are plugin-shipped capability. A plugin that owns a surface ships the
probes for it, so default health coverage requires no user configuration.

## Worked example

```toml
# The tmux plugin's pane effect: liveness is a session lookup, and activity is
# a fingerprint of the pane's visible contents.
[pane.health.alive]
type   = "shell"
script = 'tmux has-session -t "$session_name"'

[pane.health.alive.bind]
session_name = { from = "self.outputs.session_name" }

[pane.health.activity]
type   = "shell"
script = '''
PANE=$(tmux capture-pane -p -t "$session_name") || exit 1
FP=$(printf '%s' "$PANE" | cksum | tr -d ' \t')
jq -nc --arg fp "$FP" --arg at "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  '{fingerprint: $fp, observed_at: $at}'
'''

[pane.health.activity.bind]
session_name = { from = "self.outputs.session_name" }
```

```toml
# An agent-runtime effect: liveness is a process check, and activity is the
# turn-boundary record the same plugin's hook writes.
[exec_runtime.health.alive]
type   = "shell"
script = 'kill -0 "$pid"'

[exec_runtime.health.alive.bind]
pid = { from = "self.outputs.pid" }

[exec_runtime.health.activity]
type = "exec"
bin  = "codex-agent-activity"
args = ["probe", { from = "session.name" }]
```

A hook and a pane fingerprint are two implementations of one probe. Both reach
core through `activity`, so core has one probe shape to evaluate rather than
one per implementation technique.

## Validation rules

- `[health]` is optional. An effect declaring no table contributes nothing to
  health.
- `alive` and `activity` are each optional and independent: neither implies
  the other. A `[health]` table declaring neither is a load error — the only
  reason to write the header is to declare a probe.
- Unknown keys under `[health]` are a load error naming the offending key. A
  readiness-style third probe is a non-goal: health answers "is this surface
  present and moving", not "may traffic be sent".
- Each member is an action: either variant, with its values declared in
  `bind` or in `args` rather than interpolated into the script.
- Both members observe the same roots `cleanup` does, minus the ones a probe
  has no business reading: the effect's own outputs (`self.outputs.<key>`),
  its resolved inputs (`inputs.<key>`), and the session and workspace. A
  `bin = "<name>"` reference resolves against the declaring plugin.
- An effect declaration is replaced wholesale by a deeper cascade layer, so a
  user-owned overlay of a plugin effect carries its own complete `[health]`.

## Probe semantics

### alive

Run via `bash -c`. Exit zero means the surface is present. A non-zero exit or
a render failure makes the session unhealthy, and the failing task instance is
named in the reported reason. The first failing probe ends the evaluation.

### activity

Run via `bash -c`. Stdout decides what the instance contributes, and the exit
code decides the health of the probe itself. The two are orthogonal: a probe
that contributes nothing may be perfectly well, and a broken probe is a fault
whatever it managed to print.

Stdout is the activity envelope, which has exactly two legal shapes:

```json
{ "fingerprint": "waiting:7", "observed_at": "2026-08-18T00:04:06Z" }
{ "fingerprint": "waiting:7", "silence_expected": true, "observed_at": "2026-08-18T00:04:06Z" }
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `fingerprint` | An opaque token that changes whenever the probe observes new activity. Core never parses it, only compares it. Required. |
| `silence_expected` | `true` says this fingerprint's stability is intended, so its silence is pardoned: the declaring instance's expectation is narrowed. Absent or `false` withholds the pardon. |
| `observed_at` | RFC3339. Absent means the probe reports no timestamp of its own. |

The envelope is fingerprint-centric: it always carries evidence, and
`silence_expected` annotates how that evidence's stability should be read. A
pardon therefore cannot exist without evidence to pardon.

A probe holds only the pardon channel — it may lower the expectation core
derived from `done_when`, never raise one. The asymmetry is deliberate: a
wrong pardon hides a real stall, while a wrongly withheld pardon is safe,
because core's own `done_when`-derived expectation still has to agree before
anything is called stalled. The accusation is always core's. So a generic
surface fingerprint withholds `silence_expected` — a pane's contents cannot
establish that quiet is intended — while a turn-boundary probe sets it once
the turn it watches has ended.

Three outcomes contribute no activity evidence for an evaluation, and they
differ only in what the health report says about the probe:

| Outcome | Shape | Health report |
|---|---|---|
| No basis | Exit 0, empty stdout. | Silent — the instance evaluates as if it declared no probe at all. |
| Probe error | Non-zero exit. | A `probe_error` entry naming the instance, the probe command, the exit code, and a digest of stderr. |
| Invalid output | Exit 0, stdout that is not an envelope carrying a `fingerprint`. | A `probe_error` entry naming the instance, the command, and the reason. |

"No basis" is structural absence rather than a declared value, so a probe with
nothing to report cannot be confused with one whose output was rejected. A
persistently broken probe surfaces as a fault instead of passing for a quiet
surface, which is why a fingerprint-less envelope is rejected rather than
discarded or filled in.

Freshness is judged against core's own clock, not against `observed_at`: core
records when it first saw a given fingerprint, and a fingerprint that has not
changed within the workflow's stall threshold reads as stalled once activity
is expected.

## Composition across instances

A session's health is composed from every produced run-scoped task instance:

- **`alive` composes by AND.** Liveness is a chain of necessary resources, so
  any failing probe makes the session unhealthy, reported with the failing
  instance named.
- **`activity` composes by OR.** Activity is evidence of life, so evidence
  from any instance counts. Core joins the declaring instances' fingerprints
  into one composite and treats a change anywhere in it as the session having
  moved.

An instance declaring no `[health]` contributes nothing to either composition:
it is vacuous in the AND and casts no vote in the OR. So does one whose
activity probe emits no envelope.

The two shapes are complementary in practice. A pane fingerprint attests
within-turn movement that no turn boundary would show, and a turn-boundary
record attests movement a quiet pane would hide.

Declare an activity probe only for resources whose activity indicates session
progress: a chatty sidecar with an activity probe would mask a stalled agent,
so the author-declared-surface principle applies to probe placement too.

## Relationship to the workflow health cycle

A workflow's `[healthcheck]` table declares the sampling cycle — how often the
probes run, the stall threshold they are judged against, and the parent
re-notification interval. It names when health is observed; `[health]` names
what health means for one task.
