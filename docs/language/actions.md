# Actions

An action is a lifecycle execution: an effect's `setup` or `cleanup`, a health or
terminal probe, a workspace provider's `setup`, `cleanup`, or `subscribe`, a
resource observer's `observe` or `finalize`, and a channel's delivery.

Every action declares a `type`. There are two variants.

## exec

Simple process execution is structural. No shell is involved, so no quoting
question arises.

<!-- fixture: actions/exec-bin.toml -->
```toml
[bootstrap]
kind  = "effect"
scope = "run"

[bootstrap.setup]
type = "exec"
bin  = "okf-goal"
args = [
  "task",
  "bootstrap",
  "--workspace-dir",
  { from = "workspace.dir" },
  "--owner",
  { from = "inputs.owner" },
  "--session",
  { from = "session.name" },
  "--assignees",
  { from = "inputs.assignees", default = "" },
]

[bootstrap.inputs_schema]
type                 = "object"
required             = ["owner"]
additionalProperties = false

[bootstrap.inputs_schema.properties]
owner     = { type = "string" }
assignees = { type = "string" }
```

`args` elements are values: literals, projections, computations, JSON
serializations, or capability tags.

`stdin` writes one value to the process's standard input instead of its argv.
It exists for data that must not be visible in the process table, and for data
too large to be an argument.

## shell

Plecture keeps shell actions. Real imperative logic — an interactive runtime's
startup and readiness sequence, a generated wrapper script — should stay
inspectable and customizable in configuration rather than disappearing into an
opaque executable purely to avoid template syntax.

Shell source is literal. Plecture and CEL interpolation do not occur inside it.
An action instead declares the values and capabilities it needs outside that
source, in a `bind` table:

<!-- fixture: actions/shell-bind.toml -->
```toml
[runtime]
kind  = "effect"
scope = "run"

[runtime.setup]
type = "shell"
script = '''
"$activity_bin" reset "$session_name"
sh -c "$send_text" terminal-send-text "ready"
sh -c "$send_keys" terminal-send-keys Enter
'''

[runtime.setup.bind]
session_name = { from = "session.name" }
send_text    = { terminal = "send_text" }
send_keys    = { terminal = "send_keys" }
activity_bin = { bin = "codex-agent-activity" }
```

Each `bind` key becomes a shell variable name.

## The binding transport

Bindings reach the shell process through a private generated binding file, not
through argv and not through rendered shell source.

Plecture writes a mode-0600 binding file, or a generated wrapper, in a private
run directory; exports only file paths and control variables into the process
environment; and executes the literal script by path rather than as
`bash -c <rendered source>`. Bound values therefore never appear in the child
process's argv, and Plecture-owned generation handles shell escaping exactly
once.

The consequence for authors: a value bound into a shell action is data. It
cannot become part of the command that runs, and a script that relays a value
across a further boundary of its own — typing it into a terminal, for
instance — owns the quoting at that boundary.

## bin versus command

`command` is a literal OS command name or path, resolved through the process
environment exactly as an ordinary command is. It is never dynamic.

`bin` resolves a plugin-owned executable and is the preferred form in shipped
plugin config. Inside plugin-mounted config a bare `bin = "name"` resolves
against the containing plugin's own executables. In user-authored config `bin`
takes the catalog-qualified slash form: `<catalog-alias>/<plugin-path>` when
the plugin has one executable, or
`<catalog-alias>/<plugin-path>/<executable-name>` otherwise. An ambiguous
nested plugin-path reading fails loudly rather than guessing.

Shipped plugin config does not use user-local catalog aliases and cannot
reference another plugin's executable.

Because a channel's exec action can name a plugin-owned executable directly,
delivery needs no `PATH`-mangling wrapper:

<!-- fixture: channels/exec-plugin-bin.toml -->
```toml
[exec_delivery]
kind = "channel"
type = "exec"
bin  = "codex-exec-enqueue"
args = [
  { from = "inputs.queue_dir" },
  { from = "inputs.message_envelope" },
  { from = "event.type" },
  { from = "event.body" },
  { from = "event.summary" },
  { from = "event.metadata.url", default = "" },
]
timeout = { from = "inputs.enqueue_timeout", default = "5s" }

[exec_delivery.input_schema]
queue_dir        = { type = "string", required = true }
enqueue_timeout  = { type = "string", default = "5s" }
message_envelope = { type = "string", default = "[{type}] {body_or_summary}{url_suffix}" }
```

An exec action names its executable exactly once, through `bin` or `command`.

## Validation rules

- An action's `type` is `exec` or `shell`.
- An exec action declares exactly one of `bin` and `command`.
- A shell action declares `script`, and no exec-variant field.
- `script` contains no Plecture or CEL interpolation.
- An exec action's `command` is never a computed value.
- A capability tag appears only where that capability is consumable: an action
  binding, or an argv element of an action that accepts one.
- A `terminal` capability requires some effect in the plan to declare that verb.
