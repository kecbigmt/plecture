# Expressions

Plecture embeds CEL as an external language. It specifies the profile CEL is
embedded in, not CEL's grammar or semantics.

The target is the CEL language as specified by
[cel-spec](https://github.com/cel-expr/cel-spec).

## The profile

- Standard CEL syntax and operators.
- Standard primitive, list, map, object, string, numeric, boolean, and null
  values.
- The standard macros: `has`, `all`, `exists`, `exists_one`, `map`, `filter`.
- One extension library, the official CEL strings extension at version 0,
  which contributes exactly ten functions: `charAt`, `indexOf`,
  `lastIndexOf`, `lowerAscii`, `upperAscii`, `replace`, `split`, `substring`,
  `trim`, and `join`.
- No Plecture custom functions.

The extension is admitted by name and version, and the enumeration above is
the whole of it. A function a later version of that extension introduces, and
a function from any other extension library, is outside the profile. Pinning
the version is what makes the vocabulary a configuration may call the same
one this chapter lists.

Each expression site defines the variables visible at it, the expected result
type, and any Plecture-specific restriction on references. An expression is
parsed and checked ahead of evaluation against that site's environment.

<!-- fixture: expressions/macros.toml -->
```toml
[notify]
kind    = "channel"
type    = "exec"
command = "curl"
args = [
  "-d",
  { json = { text = { expr = "has(event.metadata.url) ? event.summary + ' (' + event.metadata.url + ')' : event.summary" } } },
]
```

The macros need no Plecture extension to be useful:

<!-- fixture: expressions/comprehension.toml -->
```toml
[team_runtime]
kind = "effect"

[team_runtime.setup]
type = "exec"
bin  = "agent-runtime"
args = ["launch"]

[team_runtime.outputs.bind]
mcp_server_names = { expr = "inputs.mcp_servers.map(s, s.name).join(',')" }

[team_runtime.outputs_schema]
type = "object"

[team_runtime.outputs_schema.properties]
mcp_server_names = { type = "string" }

[team_runtime.inputs_schema]
type                 = "object"
additionalProperties = false

[team_runtime.inputs_schema.properties.mcp_servers]
type = "array"

[team_runtime.inputs_schema.properties.mcp_servers.items]
type     = "object"
required = ["name"]

[team_runtime.inputs_schema.properties.mcp_servers.items.properties]
name = { type = "string" }
```

## What stays out of CEL

Plecture concepts are structural in TOML, not CEL APIs: definition references,
executable ownership, terminal capabilities, effect nesting, layer boundaries,
`from` projections, action bindings, and JSON serialization. CEL hosting
custom functions is not a reason to move any of them there.

An expression calling a function the profile does not define is
`PLECTURE-CFG-CEL-CUSTOM-FUNCTION`. That covers a function from an extension
library the profile does not admit, a function a later version of the admitted
strings extension introduces, and one that looks like a Plecture capability:

<!-- fixture: expressions/custom-function.invalid.toml -->
```toml
[notify]
kind    = "channel"
type    = "exec"
command = "curl"
args    = [{ expr = "bin('codex-exec-enqueue')" }]
```

## Typing

Plecture may project the structural portion of a JSON Schema contract into CEL
type information, and check an expression's result type against the expected
type of its field.

That projection is the sanctioned first feature to drop if implementation
complexity grows. Static resolution of roots, references, and kinds is never
dropped. A check that is dropped becomes an accepted-invalid conformance
fixture, so what the language would reject stays recorded even while the
implementation accepts it:

<!-- fixture: expressions/type-mismatch.accepted-invalid.toml -->
```toml
[review]
kind              = "task"
description       = "A task document whose computed leaf does not type-check"
resource_observer = "issue_pr"
instructions      = [{ text = "Review {{ resource.id }} and record a verdict." }]

[review.state_schema]
type = "object"

[review.state_schema.properties]
verdict_revision = { type = "string" }

[review.done_when]
all = [{ expr = "self.state.verdict_revision + 1" }]
```

Constraints that do not map naturally into the CEL type system — patterns,
enums, cross-field requirements — remain JSON Schema concerns and are enforced
at runtime validation.

## Computed nested outputs

A computed nested output binding produces a string. Typed computed nested
outputs are deferred; a computed observation in a task document may be typed
and validated against its declared key.
