# Migrating a hand-authored config to catalog plugins

This guide is for an operator whose global plect config tree predates
catalog plugins: providers, resources, tasks, workflows, channels, and
templates that were hand-authored or copied into `~/.config/plect` (or
whatever directory `PLECT_CONFIG_HOME`/`--config-home` points at) directly,
possibly wired up through hand-authored `plugin_dirs` entries in
`config.toml`. It walks that config tree to a plugin-consuming one: a
`catalogs.toml` registration, enabled plugins recorded in `plect.lock`, and
only genuinely local choices left as residual global config. See
[`docs/design/plugin-packaging.md`](design/plugin-packaging.md) for the
full model this guide cuts over to — catalogs, plugins, reference
resolution, the lockfile, and precedence — and each plugin's own `README.md`
for what it ships.

Nothing here is specific to this repository's own catalog. The steps apply
to any catalog source (`git+https`, `git+ssh`, `path`, or `path+editable`)
and any plugin set; examples below register this repository's own catalog
because it is the one guaranteed to be reachable while following along.

## 0. Prerequisites

- A `plect` binary recent enough to have `plect catalog` and `plect plugin`
  (`plect catalog add --help` succeeds).
- Git on `PATH` if any candidate catalog uses a `git+https`/`git+ssh`
  source. `path`/`path+editable` sources need no git.
- A Go toolchain if any plugin you plan to enable declares an `[[executables]]`
  entry with a `build` command in its `plugin.toml` — `plect plugin add`/
  `update` runs that build locally.

## 1. Inventory: what becomes redundant, what stays

For each plugin you intend to enable, diff your hand-authored config
against that plugin's shipped content, by **definition id, not filename** —
a provider, resource, task, workflow, channel, or template keeps its id
across the move, but the file that carries it may not keep the same name or
path.

For every standard subdirectory a candidate plugin ships
(`providers/`, `resources/`, `environments/`, `tasks/`, `workflows/`,
`channels/`, `templates/`), compare it against the same-named directory
under your config home:

| Comparison result | Disposition |
|---|---|
| Your file defines the same id with identical (or now-superseded, less-capable) content | Redundant. Delete it in the cutover step. |
| Your file defines the same id with content that differs on purpose (a local patch, a house style, a different flag) | A divergence — do not delete it yet. Handle it in [Divergence handling](#4-divergence-handling) below. |
| Your file defines an id the plugin does not ship at all | User-owned residue. It stays, unchanged, as global config. |

Typical residue, independent of which plugins you enable: resource
allowlist entries (`resource_allowlist` in `config.toml`), `workdirs_root`,
authentication configured outside plect, team-specific workflow overlays
that only add nodes or channels to a plugin workflow, and prompt templates
that encode team operating style rather than a plugin default.

Also note every `config.toml` `plugin_dirs` entry that points at a
directory whose content a candidate plugin now supersedes. These are the
entries [step 3](#3-cutover) removes — see the warning there for why leaving
them in place is not just redundant but breaks loading.

## 2. Verify in isolation

Do this before touching your real config home. Point `PLECT_CONFIG_HOME` at
an empty scratch directory so a mistake here cannot affect production
sessions; the plugin cache and runtime state still resolve from your real
XDG data/cache dirs (they are keyed by source and lock coordinate, not by
config home, so cache reuse across environments is safe), only
`config.toml`, `catalogs.toml`, `plect.lock`, and the global overlays move.

```bash
export PLECT_CONFIG_HOME="$(mktemp -d)"

plect catalog add official git+https://github.com/kecbigmt/plecture --subdir plugins --revision main
plect plugin add official/github
plect plugin verify
plect plugin list
```

`plect catalog add` shows the resolved source, lock coordinate, and
published plugin paths, and asks for interactive confirmation before
writing anything — confirm only after checking those against what you
expect. Repeat `plect plugin add <alias>/<path>` for every plugin from your
inventory. `plect plugin verify` re-hashes the mounted content against
`plect.lock` and should report every plugin `ok`.

Check that plugin-shipped templates and workflows resolve:

```bash
plect template list
plect template render <name>          # for a template you expect the plugin to ship
plect workflow list
```

If a workflow can be exercised safely against a disposable resource
(harmless issue/branch, throwaway repo, or similar), run a dispatch smoke
test end to end:

```bash
plect up <resource-id> --workflow <workflow-id> --detach
plect status <resource-id>
plect destroy <resource-id>
```

A clean `plect status` with the tasks you expect and a clean `plect destroy`
confirm the plugin's setup/cleanup hooks actually run, not just that its
TOML parses. Once satisfied, discard the scratch directory:

```bash
rm -rf "$PLECT_CONFIG_HOME"
unset PLECT_CONFIG_HOME
```

## 3. Cutover

Back up first. The whole config home is the unit to copy, not individual
files — `catalogs.toml`, `config.toml`, and the global overlay directories
all change together in this procedure:

```bash
cp -r ~/.config/plect ~/.config/plect.pre-plugins-backup
```

(Substitute your actual config home if `PLECT_CONFIG_HOME`/`--config-home`
overrides the default.)

Then, against your real config home:

1. Register each catalog identified in the inventory step, the same way as
   in verification:

   ```bash
   plect catalog add <alias> <source> [--revision <rev>]
   ```

   Non-interactive contexts (scripts, CI) must pass `--yes` explicitly —
   there is no silent default confirmation.

2. Enable every plugin from the inventory:

   ```bash
   plect plugin add <alias>/<path>
   ```

3. Delete the config files identified as redundant in step 1: hand-authored
   `providers/`, `resources/`, `environments/`, `tasks/`, `workflows/`,
   `channels/`, and `templates/` files whose id now comes from an enabled
   plugin.

4. Remove the `plugin_dirs` entries noted in step 1 whose content the newly
   enabled plugins now supersede.

   **This step is not optional.** Same-id conflicts between plugin layers
   are load errors, not a declaration-order pick — a hand-authored
   `plugin_dirs` entry that still defines the same provider, resource, task,
   workflow, or template id as a newly enabled catalog plugin makes every
   later `plect` invocation fail to load, with an error naming the
   conflicting id and both plugin layers. `config.toml`'s `plugin_dirs`
   entries not superseded by any enabled plugin are residue and stay.

5. Leave every other file identified as residue untouched.

Run `plect plugin verify` once more against the real config home to confirm
the mounted content still matches `plect.lock`, then exercise your normal
workflows for a session or two before relying on the cutover for
unattended use.

## 4. Divergence handling

A divergence from step 1 — your existing definition and the plugin's
shipped definition share an id but differ in content on purpose — has two
resolutions, and picking between them is a per-divergence judgment call,
not a default:

- **Fold it into a user-owned override.** Per the shadowing and precedence
  rules in the design, the user layer (global config or a trusted ancestor
  overlay) always wins over plugin layers. For providers, resources,
  environments, tasks, channels, and templates this means placing a full
  same-id definition in global config or an overlay — there is no
  partial-field patch for these kinds. For workflows, a same-named
  workflow file in an overlay can add new `[[nodes]]` or
  `[[event.channel]]` entries without redeclaring the plugin's singleton
  fields. This is the right choice when the divergence is genuinely local:
  a team convention, a credential path, an internal service the plugin has
  no way to know about.
- **Upstream it.** If the divergence is a fix or an improvement that other
  consumers of the same catalog would also want, contribute it back to the
  catalog as a change to the plugin's shipped definition, then delete your
  local override once the catalog is updated (`plect catalog update`/
  `plect plugin update`) and re-verify. This is the right choice when the
  divergence isn't actually local — it just hadn't been shipped yet.

When in doubt, start with the override (it is reversible and takes effect
immediately); an override that turns out to match what everyone wants is a
prompt to upstream it later, not a decision to make once and never revisit.

## 5. Rollback

Restoring the pre-cutover config home from the backup restores pre-cutover
behavior exactly — plugin directories are mounted read-only and never write
back into user config, so nothing outside the config home needs to be
undone:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/plect
cp -r ~/.config/plect.pre-plugins-backup ~/.config/plect
```

No plect process should be running against the config home while the
rollback is applied, since a concurrent write to `catalogs.toml` or
`plect.lock` could otherwise interleave with the copy. There is nothing
else to reverse: catalog additions only ever mount read-only content
alongside the pre-existing config, they never rewrite or delete anything
outside the files this guide already touches in the cutover step.
