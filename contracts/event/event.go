// Package event defines the shared contract types for the plect event bus:
// a per-session, append-only, durable pub/sub log.
//
// The bus core (eventlog, bus server) treats SessionName and Type as opaque
// strings — it does not interpret provider-specific structure (a resource
// provider's identifier shape, a chat provider's thread ids, etc.).
// Producers own their Type namespace (a chat provider's message type, an
// agent's reply type, a resource provider's own change-type prefix, ...);
// the core only routes and filters. Provider-specific Source/Type constants
// belong in that provider's own package, not here.
//
// This module is zero-dependency (stdlib only) so app and plugins
// can all import it, mirroring contracts/{state,hook,channel-protocol}.
